# AIML Midterm Exam – Correlation Analysis

## Task
The goal of this exam task is to:
- Find **Pearson’s correlation coefficient** for the given dataset.
- Provide a graph for visualization.
- Document the process clearly.

---

## Steps Taken

1. I downloaded the dataset from: [max.ge/aiml_midterm/847293_html](http://max.ge/aiml_midterm/847293_html).
2. Loaded the dataset into Python using `pandas`.
3. Calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient using both the formula and the `scipy.stats.pearsonr` function.
4. Created a scatter plot with a regression line for visualization.

## Formula

The Pearson correlation coefficient is calculated as:

r = Σ(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ) / √(Σ(xi - x̄)² Σ(yi - ȳ)²)

---

## Results

- **Pearson correlation coefficient (r):** `RESULT_HERE`
- **Interpretation:**  
  - If r ≈ 1 → strong positive correlation  
  - If r ≈ -1 → strong negative correlation  
  - If r ≈ 0 → no correlation

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/aiml_midterm_correlation.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib scipy
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python correlation.py
   ```

This will print Pearson’s correlation coefficient and show the plot.
